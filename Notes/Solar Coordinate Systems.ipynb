    "* The major frames are Stonyhurst and Carrington. Stonyhurst has longitude 0 tied to the Earth-Sun line and so rotates with respect to the stars with the Earth's angular velocity. Carrington-heliographic has its 0 longitude set to a fixed point relative to an approximate mean rotation rate for the Sun as defined by Carrington (1863)"
